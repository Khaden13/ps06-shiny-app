The data I chose to use was the UAH Lower Troposphere Temperature Data. The data contains 4 variables.
1. **Year**: The year the data was recorded
2. **Month**: The month the data was recorded
3. **Region**: The region the data was recorded
4. **Temp**: The temperature that was recorded at the specific region at the specific time
To better summarize the data, I created three separate panels to show different data types.
- **Summary**: This panel shows a overall summary of the data, with a short description and a random sample of the data shown.
- **Plot**: This panel shows various graphs on the overall temperature distribution depending on the region. There are widgets to change what region is being shown, what color the graph is showing, and whether or not you want to see a trend line.
- **Table**: This panel shows you various tables of different time periods and the maximum and minimum temperature for each. There is a widget that allows you to switch between what kind of time period you are looking at.
